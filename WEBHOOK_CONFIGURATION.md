## Webhook Functionality

### What Happens When a User Purchases Credits

1. **User clicks "Buy Credits"** on retrophotoai.com
2. **Stripe Checkout opens** with credit pack ($9.99 for 10 credits)
3. **User completes payment** using credit card
4. **Stripe processes payment** and creates checkout session
5. **Stripe sends webhook** to `https://retrophotoai.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
6. **Webhook handler verifies** signature using webhook secret
7. **Credits are added** to user account via `add_credits()` function
8. **User receives** 10 credits instantly
9. **User can immediately use** credits for photo restorations

### Webhook Endpoint Behavior

```typescript
// Endpoint: POST /api/webhooks/stripe
// Method: POST only (405 for GET/other methods)
// Authentication: Stripe signature verification
// Response: 200 OK (immediate acknowledgment)
// Processing: Asynchronous credit addition
```

## Security Features

### Implemented Security Measures

- ‚úÖ **Signature Verification** - Validates webhook authenticity using Stripe SDK
- ‚úÖ **Idempotency Handling** - Prevents double-crediting on webhook retries
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS Only** - Endpoint requires secure connection
- ‚úÖ **Event Tracking** - In-memory tracking of processed events
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup** - Removes old event IDs (keeps last 1000)
- ‚úÖ **Service Role Auth** - Database updates use service role (bypasses RLS)
- ‚úÖ **Atomic Operations** - Race condition prevention in credit updates

### Webhook Signature Verification

```typescript
// Verification process:
1. Extract Stripe-Signature header
2. Get raw request body
3. Verify using webhook secret
4. Construct validated Event object
5. Process only if signature is valid
```

---

## Testing Instructions

### Test in Stripe Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click **"Send test webhook"** button
4. Select event: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Click **"Send test webhook"**
6. Check response: Should be **200 OK**

### Expected Test Response

```json
{
  "received": true
}
```

### View Webhook Logs

**Stripe Dashboard:**
- URL: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
- Click on webhook endpoint
- View "Events" tab
- See delivery attempts and responses

**Vercel Logs:**
- URL: https://vercel.com/empathylabs/retrophoto/logs
- Filter by: `/api/webhooks/stripe`
- Look for: "Checkout completed" and "Credits added successfully"

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Success Indicators

Look for these log messages in Vercel logs:

```
‚úÖ Checkout completed: {
  sessionId: 'cs_live_...',
  userId: '...',
  customerId: 'cus_...',
  amountTotal: 999
}

‚úÖ Credits added successfully: {
  userId: '...',
  creditsAdded: 10,
  newBalance: 10
}
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: Webhook shows "Failed" in Stripe Dashboard

**Possible Causes:**
- Wrong webhook secret
- Deployment not complete
- Database connection issue

**Solutions:**
1. Verify webhook secret matches in both Stripe and Vercel
2. Check Vercel deployment completed successfully
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors

#### Issue: Payment succeeds but credits not added

**Possible Causes:**
- Webhook not triggered
- Event type not handled
- Database function error

**Solutions:**
1. Check Stripe webhook logs for delivery status
2. Verify events are configured correctly
3. Check Supabase logs for function errors

#### Issue: Duplicate credits added

**Should Not Happen** - Idempotency handling prevents this

**If it does:**
1. Check webhook logs for duplicate event IDs
2. Verify idempotency logic is working
3. Check for multiple webhook endpoints configured

## Database Integration

### Credit Addition Flow

```sql
-- Function called by webhook
SELECT * FROM add_credits(
  p_user_id := 'user_123',
  p_fingerprint := 'fp_abc',
  p_credits_to_add := 10,
  p_stripe_customer_id := 'cus_xyz'
);

-- Result
{
  new_balance: 10,
  success: true
}
```

### Database Tables

**`user_credits` table:**
- Tracks credit balance per user
- Stores purchase history
- Links to Stripe customer ID
- Atomic operations for thread safety
