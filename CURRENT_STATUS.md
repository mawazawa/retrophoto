---

### 3. Payment System (100% Code Complete) ✅

#### Stripe Integration
- **Checkout Session**: `/api/create-checkout-session/route.ts` ✅
  - Guest checkout supported (fingerprint-based)
  - Authenticated user checkout
  - Server-side price validation
  - Error codes: STRIPE_UNAVAILABLE, MISSING_IDENTIFIER

- **Webhook Handler**: `/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts` ✅
  - Signature verification
  - Database-backed idempotency
  - Event handlers:
    - `checkout.session.completed` → Add credits
    - `charge.refunded` → Deduct credits (supports negative balance)
    - Payment failure logging
  - Error codes: INVALID_SIGNATURE, WEBHOOK_PROCESSING_FAILED

- **Database Functions** (in migration 016):
  - `add_credits(user_id, credits, transaction_id)` - FIFO batch creation
  - `deduct_credit(user_id)` - FIFO deduction
  - `process_refund(transaction_id, refund_id, amount, currency)` - Refund handling
  - `expire_credits()` - Cron job for expiration

#### UI Components
- **PurchaseCreditsButton** (`components/credits/purchase-credits-button.tsx`) ✅
- **CreditBalance** (`components/credits/credit-balance.tsx`) ✅
- **PurchaseHistory** (`components/credits/purchase-history.tsx`) ✅
- **Credit Quota Helpers** (`lib/credits/quota.ts`) ✅

#### Cron Jobs
- **Credit Expiration** (`app/api/cron/expire-credits/route.ts`) ✅
  - Protected with `CRON_SECRET`
  - Calls `expire_credits()` function
  - Returns metrics: users_affected, total_credits_expired

---

### 4. Credit System Integration (100% Complete) ✅

#### Restore Endpoint Enhanced
- **Credit Detection** (`app/api/restore/route.ts`) ✅
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - Checks if user has available credits
  - Deducts credit via `deduct_credit()` RPC before processing
  - Falls back to free quota for guests or users without credits
  - Only increments quota counter for free-tier users
  - Tracks `user_id` in upload_sessions for authenticated users

#### Payment Flow (End-to-End)
```
1. User purchases credits → Stripe checkout
2. Stripe webhook → add_credits() RPC → Creates batch (1-year expiration)
3. User restores photo → deduct_credit() RPC → FIFO from oldest batch
4. Credits tracked per batch, expire after 1 year
5. User gets refund → process_refund() RPC → Allows negative balance
```

**Status**: Fully integrated. Authenticated users with credits use paid system, others use free quota.

---

### 5. AI Architecture (100% Complete - Phase 1) ✅

#### Core Architecture Implemented
- **Multi-model types** (`lib/ai/types.ts`) ✅
  - 7 model types defined (anthropic_sonnet_4_5, openai_gpt5_thinking, google_gemini_pro_2_5, xai_grok4_fast, groq_kimi_k2, replicate_swinir, ensemble)
  - ImageAnalysis, DamageProfile, RestorationResult types
  - Quality report structures (FADGI scoring)

- **Triage System** (`lib/ai/triage.ts`) ✅
  - Uses Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 for image analysis
  - Intelligent model routing with 5 decision rules:
    - Rule 1: Portraits with high fading → GPT-5 Thinking
    - Rule 2: Multi-face portraits → GPT-5 Thinking
    - Rule 3: Landscapes with color fading → Gemini Pro 2.5
    - Rule 4: Documents/text → Grok 4 Fast Reasoning
    - Rule 5: Mixed content → SwinIR (reliable fallback)
  - Cost estimation per model ($0.02 triage + $0.04-$0.18 primary + $0.05 upscaling + $0.01 validation)

- **Orchestrator** (`lib/ai/orchestrator.ts`) ✅
  - 3-step restoration pipeline:
    - Step 1: Triage (analyze and route)
    - Step 2: Primary restoration (selected model)
    - Step 3: Quality validation (FADGI scoring)
  - Batch processing support (sequential with queue system hooks)
  - Cost breakdown tracking
  - Processing time metrics

- **Quality Validator** (`lib/ai/quality-validator.ts`) ✅
  - FADGI scoring (Federal Agencies Digital Guidelines Initiative)
  - 5 quality checks:
    1. Resolution check (min 1200px short edge)
    2. Over-sharpening detection (AI artifact)
    3. Over-smoothing detection (unnatural blur)
    4. Color balance analysis
    5. Damage removal estimation
  - Grade assignment (4-star: 90+, 3-star: 80-89, 2-star: 70-79, fail: <70)
  - Recommendations: APPROVED (70+), WARN (60-69), REJECT (<60)

#### Phase 2 Provider Implementations (Pending)
- `lib/ai/providers/openai.ts` - GPT-5 Thinking for portraits
- `lib/ai/providers/gemini.ts` - Gemini Pro 2.5 for landscapes
- `lib/ai/providers/xai.ts` - Grok 4 Fast for documents
- `lib/ai/providers/groq.ts` - Kimi K2 for quality validation

**Current Behavior**: Phase 1 complete with intelligent routing. All routes use SwinIR (proven reliable) until Phase 2 providers are implemented. Architecture ready for drop-in provider integration.

**Required API Keys**:
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (triage) - REQUIRED for Phase 1
- REPLICATE_API_TOKEN (SwinIR) - REQUIRED for Phase 1
- All other keys - OPTIONAL for Phase 2

---

### 6. Authentication (100% Complete) ✅

#### Supabase Auth Implementation
- **Server Client** (`lib/supabase/server.ts`) ✅
  - Uses `@supabase/ssr` (latest package)
  - Cookie-based session management

- **Client Client** (`lib/supabase/client.ts`) ✅
  - Browser client for client components

- **Middleware** (`middleware.ts`) ✅
  - Session refresh
  - Uses `getUser()` (not `getSession()` - security best practice)
  - Guest mode support (fingerprint-based)

#### Auth Flows
- Email/password sign-up ✅
- Email/password sign-in ✅
- Google OAuth ✅ (configured in Supabase)
- Session management ✅
- Sign-out ✅

**Security**: Follows Oct 2025 best practices (cookie-based, getUser() in server code).
