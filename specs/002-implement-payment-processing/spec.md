## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to restore vintage photos beyond the free tier limit. They need a simple, secure way to purchase additional restoration credits. After purchasing, they should immediately have access to their credits and be able to continue restoring photos without interruption. The payment process should be trustworthy, transparent about pricing, and provide clear confirmation of the transaction.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user with no remaining free credits, **When** they attempt to restore a photo, **Then** they are shown an upgrade option with clear pricing

2. **Given** a user clicks "Buy 10 Credits", **When** they are redirected to payment checkout, **Then** they see a secure payment form with the exact amount ($9.99) and product description

3. **Given** a user completes payment successfully, **When** the payment is processed, **Then** their account is immediately credited with 10 restoration credits

4. **Given** a user completes payment successfully, **When** they return to the app, **Then** they see a confirmation message and their updated credit balance

5. **Given** a user cancels during checkout, **When** they return to the app, **Then** they see a message explaining they can try again and no charge was made

6. **Given** a payment fails (declined card), **When** the failure is detected, **Then** the user is notified with a clear error message and option to try a different payment method

7. **Given** a user has purchased credits, **When** they check their account history, **Then** they can see a record of their purchase including date, amount, and credits received

8. **Given** a duplicate payment webhook is received, **When** the system processes it, **Then** credits are only added once (idempotency protection)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user initiates payment but closes the browser mid-transaction?
  - System should not credit account until payment confirmation webhook is received
  - User can safely restart the purchase process

- How does the system handle partial refunds or disputes?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Refund policy - full/partial/none? Time limit? Process?]

- What happens if webhook delivery fails or is delayed?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Webhook retry mechanism and timeout duration]
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Manual credit reconciliation process for failed webhooks]

- How does system handle users attempting to purchase while already at maximum credit balance?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a maximum credit balance limit?]

- What happens when payment succeeds but credit allocation fails (database error)?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error recovery and manual intervention process]

- How are taxes handled for different jurisdictions?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Tax calculation, collection, and reporting requirements]

- What happens if a user's payment method expires or is declined for a future charge?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Only relevant if subscriptions are implemented]

### Key Entities

- **User Account**: Represents an authenticated user with credit balance, purchase history, and payment preferences. Links to all transactions and credit adjustments.

- **Credit Balance**: Current number of restoration credits available to a user. Incremented on purchase, decremented on usage. Must be accurate and never negative.

- **Transaction**: Represents a payment event including amount paid, credits purchased, timestamp, payment status (pending/completed/failed/refunded), and payment provider reference ID. Immutable record for audit trail.

- **Payment Session**: Temporary session linking user to checkout process. Contains session ID, amount, status, and expiration time. Cleaned up after completion or timeout.

- **Webhook Event**: Incoming notification from payment provider. Contains event type, payload, signature for validation, processing status (pending/processed/failed), and timestamp. Ensures idempotency.

- **Purchase History**: User-viewable record of all credit purchases including date, amount paid, credits received, receipt URL, and refund status.

- **Admin Reconciliation Record**: Manual adjustments to credit balances with reason, administrator identity, timestamp, and audit trail. Used for error correction.

## Next Steps

Before proceeding to planning phase, the following clarifications are needed:

1. **Refund Policy**: Define full/partial refund eligibility, time limits, and credit deduction handling
2. **Tax Handling**: Specify tax calculation requirements, supported jurisdictions, and compliance needs
3. **Webhook Reliability**: Define retry strategy, timeout limits, and manual reconciliation triggers
4. **Credit Expiration**: Confirm if credits expire and after what duration
5. **Currency Support**: List all currencies to support beyond USD
6. **Receipt Requirements**: Define email receipt content, format, and delivery timing
7. **Credit Limits**: Specify if maximum credit balance exists and its value
8. **Error Recovery**: Define process when payment succeeds but credit allocation fails

Once these clarifications are provided, this specification will be ready for the `/plan` phase.
