## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: Do purchased credits expire? ‚Üí A: Credits expire after 1 year from purchase
- Q: If a user requests a refund after already using some credits, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Full refund - allow full refund, deduct used credits from balance (can go negative)
- Q: If webhook delivery from the payment provider fails, how should the system handle credit allocation? ‚Üí A: Automatic retry - rely on payment provider's webhook retry mechanism only
- Q: How should the system handle sales tax for purchases? ‚Üí A: Automatic tax - payment provider calculates and collects tax based on location
- Q: Which currencies should the payment system support? ‚Üí A: Payment provider default - support all currencies the payment provider offers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user wants to restore vintage photos beyond the free tier limit. They need a simple, secure way to purchase additional restoration credits. After purchasing, they should immediately have access to their credits and be able to continue restoring photos without interruption. The payment process should be trustworthy, transparent about pricing, and provide clear confirmation of the transaction.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user with no remaining free credits, **When** they attempt to restore a photo, **Then** they are shown an upgrade option with clear pricing

2. **Given** a user clicks "Buy 10 Credits", **When** they are redirected to payment checkout, **Then** they see a secure payment form with the exact amount ($9.99) and product description

3. **Given** a user completes payment successfully, **When** the payment is processed, **Then** their account is immediately credited with 10 restoration credits

4. **Given** a user completes payment successfully, **When** they return to the app, **Then** they see a confirmation message and their updated credit balance

5. **Given** a user cancels during checkout, **When** they return to the app, **Then** they see a message explaining they can try again and no charge was made

6. **Given** a payment fails (declined card), **When** the failure is detected, **Then** the user is notified with a clear error message and option to try a different payment method

7. **Given** a user has purchased credits, **When** they check their account history, **Then** they can see a record of their purchase including date, amount, and credits received

8. **Given** a duplicate payment webhook is received, **When** the system processes it, **Then** credits are only added once (idempotency protection)

9. **Given** a user has credits expiring in 30 days, **When** the system runs expiration check, **Then** the user receives a notification about upcoming expiration

10. **Given** credits have reached their 1-year expiration date, **When** the system processes expirations, **Then** expired credits are removed from the user's balance

11. **Given** a user requests a refund for a purchase, **When** the refund is processed, **Then** 10 credits are deducted from their balance (even if already spent, resulting in negative balance)

12. **Given** a user has a negative credit balance, **When** they attempt to restore a photo, **Then** they are prevented from proceeding and shown a message explaining the negative balance

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user initiates payment but closes the browser mid-transaction?
  - System should not credit account until payment confirmation webhook is received
  - User can safely restart the purchase process

- How does the system handle partial refunds or disputes?
  - Full refunds are allowed at any time
  - Used credits are deducted from balance, allowing negative balance
  - Users with negative balance cannot perform new restorations

- What happens if webhook delivery fails or is delayed?
  - Payment provider automatically retries webhook delivery using their built-in retry mechanism
  - System logs all webhook attempts for audit purposes
  - Admin interface available for manual credit reconciliation if automatic retries fail

- How does system handle users attempting to purchase while already at maximum credit balance?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is there a maximum credit balance limit?]

- What happens when payment succeeds but credit allocation fails (database error)?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Error recovery and manual intervention process]

- How are taxes handled for different jurisdictions?
  - Payment provider automatically calculates and collects applicable sales tax based on customer billing address
  - No manual tax configuration required in the system

- What happens if a user's payment method expires or is declined for a future charge?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Only relevant if subscriptions are implemented]

- **Transaction**: Represents a payment event including amount paid, currency, credits purchased, timestamp, payment status (pending/completed/failed/refunded), and payment provider reference ID. Immutable record for audit trail.

- **Payment Session**: Temporary session linking user to checkout process. Contains session ID, amount, status, and expiration time. Cleaned up after completion or timeout.

- **Webhook Event**: Incoming notification from payment provider. Contains event type, payload, signature for validation, processing status (pending/processed/failed), and timestamp. Ensures idempotency.

- **Purchase History**: User-viewable record of all credit purchases including date, amount paid, credits received, receipt URL, and refund status.

- **Admin Reconciliation Record**: Manual adjustments to credit balances with reason, administrator identity, timestamp, and audit trail. Used for error correction.

## Next Steps

**Status**: ‚úÖ Specification complete and ready for planning phase

All critical ambiguities have been resolved through the clarification session on 2025-10-03. The specification now contains:
- Clear credit expiration policy (1 year)
- Defined refund handling (full refund with negative balance support)
- Webhook retry strategy (payment provider handles retries)
- Tax calculation approach (payment provider auto-calculates)
- Currency support (all payment provider currencies)

Low-impact implementation details (email receipt format, max credit balance, specific error recovery flows) can be determined during the `/plan` phase as they don't affect core architecture or acceptance criteria.

**Ready for**: `/plan` command to generate implementation plan
