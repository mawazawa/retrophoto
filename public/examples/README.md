# Before/After Example Images

This directory contains example images for the before/after comparison slider on the landing page.

## Required Images

- `before.jpg` - The "before" image showing a damaged/faded old photo
- `after.jpg` - The "after" image showing the same photo restored in HD quality

## Image Specifications

- **Recommended dimensions**: 1920x1080 or 16:9 aspect ratio
- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Max file size**: 500KB each (optimize for web)
- **Content**: Should clearly demonstrate the transformation from damaged to restored

## Replacing Placeholder Images

1. Add your before image as `before.jpg`
2. Add your after image as `after.jpg`
3. Ensure both images are the same dimensions
4. Optimize images for web (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)

The slider component will automatically load these images.
