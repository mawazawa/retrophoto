# RetroPhoto Manifesto
## Building Memory Preservation for Generations

---

## Our Vision: Why We'll Be Here in 100 Years

**Memory is humanity's most precious possession.** Every photograph is a portal to a moment that will never return—a grandparent's smile, a child's first steps, a family gathered around a table. These moments deserve to outlive us.

RetroPhoto exists to ensure that **no memory is ever lost to time.** We believe that in 100 years, our descendants will look back at photographs from today with the same wonder we have for images from the 1920s. And when they do, RetroPhoto will still be there—preserving, restoring, and protecting the visual history of humanity.

**We are not building a photo app. We are building an institution of memory.**

---

## Our Mission

**To democratize professional-grade photo restoration, making it instant, affordable, and accessible to everyone, everywhere.**

In the past, restoring a damaged photograph required:
- Mailing precious originals to specialists (risk of loss)
- Waiting weeks for results
- Paying $50-$200 per photo
- Accepting that most photos would never be restored

**We reject this reality.** Using cutting-edge AI, we compress decades of restoration expertise into seconds, delivering results that rival human specialists at a fraction of the cost. No subscriptions. No complexity. No barriers.

**Upload. Wait seconds. Download perfection.**

---

## Our Core Values

### 1. **Radical Simplicity**
Every unnecessary step is a betrayal of our users' time.
- **Zero clicks to start**: Drag-and-drop from homepage
- **No accounts required** for first restoration
- **No subscriptions**: Pay only for what you use
- **No jargon**: AI complexity hidden behind elegance

**Measurement**: Can a 75-year-old grandmother restore her wedding photo in under 30 seconds? If not, we failed.

---

### 2. **Obsessive Excellence**
Good enough is the enemy of greatness.
- **Multi-model AI ensemble**: We don't trust one algorithm—we use the best from Anthropic (Sonnet 4.5), OpenAI (GPT-5 Thinking), Google (Gemini Pro 2.5), X.ai (Grok 4 Fast Reasoning), Groq Cloud (Kimi K2), and Replicate
- **60fps comparison sliders**: Smooth as silk, always
- **Sub-6-second processing** (p50 latency): Faster than competitors
- **Pixel-perfect restoration**: We validate every output

**Standard**: If it doesn't delight us, we don't ship it.

---

### 3. **Trust Through Transparency**
Your photos are sacred. We treat them that way.
- **24-hour auto-deletion**: Originals and results vanish from our servers
- **Server-side AI**: Your API keys never leave our infrastructure
- **No tracking pixels**: We don't sell your data
- **Open roadmap**: Users vote on features

**Promise**: Your memories belong to you, not our database.

---

### 4. **Relentless Velocity**
Speed is a feature. Waiting is a bug.
- **First interaction in <30 seconds**: From landing to upload
- **Restoration in <6 seconds** (p50): Faster than reading this sentence
- **Deploy daily**: Ship improvements, not excuses
- **Zero downtime**: 99.99% uptime SLA

**Philosophy**: Every second we waste is a second stolen from someone's life.

---

### 5. **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable**
If it's not accessible, it's broken.
- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance**: Screen readers, keyboard navigation, high contrast
- **Mobile-first design**: Works on a 2015 Android phone
- **Offline PWA**: No internet? Queue restorations for later
- **Fair pricing**: $0.99/photo, not $50

**Belief**: Memory preservation is a human right, not a luxury.

---

### 6. **Joy in Every Pixel**
Delight is the difference between tools and magic.
- **Confetti on success** (dismissible, respects `prefers-reduced-motion`)
- **Shimmer loading** (not soul-crushing spinners)
- **Pinch-to-zoom on faces**: See your grandmother's eyes in HD
- **Before/after slider**: The moment of revelation

**Goal**: Make users smile, then share.

---

### 7. **Community Over Competition**
We win when memories are saved, period.
- **Open research**: Publish our AI techniques
- **API for developers**: Embed restoration anywhere
- **Non-profit partnerships**: Free restorations for museums, archives
- **User-driven roadmap**: Build what matters

**Truth**: There are 2 trillion photos in the world. There's room for everyone.

2. **Best-in-class AI**: Multi-model ensemble (6 providers) vs. single model
3. **No subscriptions**: Pay $9.99 for 10 credits, use them forever (vs. monthly fees)
4. **Privacy-first**: 24-hour auto-deletion (vs. indefinite storage)
5. **Instant social sharing**: OG cards + GIFs generated automatically

---

## Our Product Philosophy

### **The 3-Click Rule**
From landing page to downloaded restoration in 3 clicks:
1. **Click 1**: Upload photo (or drag-drop = 0 clicks)
2. **Click 2**: (Optional) Buy credits if quota exhausted
3. **Click 3**: Download restored photo

**No navigation. No forms. No friction.**

---

### **The 30-Second North Star Metric (NSM)**
**"Time to first restoration"** must be <30 seconds for 95% of users.

Why 30 seconds?
- **Psychological threshold**: Attention spans on mobile
- **Competitive moat**: Remini averages 3-5 minutes (account creation + upload + processing)
- **Viral coefficient**: Fast = shareable = growth

**Current p50**: 18 seconds ✅
**Current p95**: 29 seconds ✅

---

### **The "Grandma Test"**
**Before shipping any feature, ask:**
> "Could my 75-year-old grandmother, who uses an iPhone SE, restore a photo of her late husband without help?"

If the answer is "maybe" or "with instructions," **it's not ready.**

---

## Why We'll Succeed (And Last 100 Years)

### **1. Massive, Evergreen Market**
- **2 trillion photos exist globally** (Source: InfoTrends)
- **120 billion new photos taken annually**
- **15% are damaged or degraded** → 300 billion addressable photos
- **Market size**: $4.5B photo restoration + $18B photo printing/preservation

**Tailwind**: Baby Boomers (77M in US) are digitizing family archives NOW. Gen Z discovers film cameras and Polaroids as "vintage cool." Demand grows from both ends.

---

### **2. Defensible AI Moat**
- **Multi-model ensemble**: Competitors use 1 model. We orchestrate 6+.
- **Continuous training**: Every restoration improves our algorithms (with user opt-in)
- **Proprietary quality metrics**: We measure 47 dimensions of restoration quality
- **Speed advantage**: 3x faster than nearest competitor (6s vs. 15s)

**Moat deepens over time**: More restorations → better AI → faster results → more users → repeat.

---

### **3. Network Effects**
- **Viral sharing**: Every restored photo shared on social media is free advertising
- **Referral program** (Phase 2): "Give 1 free restoration, get 1 free"
- **API ecosystem**: Developers embed RetroPhoto → we become infrastructure
- **Non-profit partnerships**: Museums preserve archives with us → credibility

**Flywheel**: Better results → more shares → more users → more data → better results.

---

### **4. Emotional Moat**
We don't restore photos. **We restore people.**

Competitor reviews:
- Remini: "Great app, but subscription is annoying"
- MyHeritage: "Cool animations, but creepy"
- Hotpot: "Good results, clunky interface"

**RetroPhoto reviews** (target sentiment):
> "I cried when I saw my dad's face restored. He passed 20 years ago and I'd forgotten how he looked when he smiled. Thank you."

**Emotion beats features.** Always.

---

**Unit economics (10 credits for $9.99):**
- Revenue: $9.99
- COGS (AI processing): $0.80 (10 photos × $0.08/photo)
- Payment processing (Stripe): $0.59 (2.9% + $0.30)
- Hosting (Vercel + Supabase): $0.15
- **Gross profit**: $8.45 (84.6% margin)

**Path to profitability:**
