/**
 * Contract Test: POST /api/webhooks/stripe
 * Feature: 002-implement-payment-processing
 * Contract: specs/002-implement-payment-processing/contracts/stripe-webhook.json
 *
 * Tests Stripe webhook signature verification and event processing
 *
 * NOTE: Full implementation deferred to Phase 4 (Core Implementation)
 * Webhook route exists but needs updates for:
 * - error_code fields in responses
 * - Database-backed idempotency via stripe_webhook_events table
 * - Credit batch creation instead of simple add_credits
